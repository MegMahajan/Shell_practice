$@ treats each quoted arguments as separate arguments but $* will consider the entire set of positional parameters as a single string.

 [ -z “” ] && echo 0 || echo 1  -- check empty or not

    If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word is substituted. 
    Otherwise, the value of parameter is substituted.
    
    echo ${new:-variable} -- variable
